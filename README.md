# Boston-Airbnb-Data-Analysis-Preprocessing
In the realm of data science, insights are often hidden within datasets waiting to be discovered. As part of my Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree project, I delved into analyzing Boston's Airbnb data. This exploration aimed to uncover patterns and insights based on specific criteria.

# Business Understanding
In this section, we gained an understanding of the operations, the nature of the business, the demand, and what it requires from a data scientist to work as a business analyst. Additionally, we added features that enhance business accuracy in a modern way.

we asked 4 questions to understand what is going on with AirBnB in boston and We will analyze a dataset to try to answer these questions.

Q1 - What is room type?

Q2 - What is the breakdown of property types by percentage?

Q3 - How are bed types distributed among the listings?

Q4 - Sentiment Analysis

# Data Understanding
This dataset contains Airbnb listings in Boston as of a specific scrape date. It includes details such as listing URLs, names, descriptions, host information, location attributes, property types, room types, pricing, availability, and review scores. Each row represents a unique listing with various features related to accommodations and host characteristics.

# Prepare Data
During the data preparation phase, we first collected the dataset, conducted an initial assessment, and then focused on cleaning our selected columns. This process involved leveraging Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas.


# Data Mdoeling 
We plotted various relevant behaviors related to the four questions using Python libraries matplotlib and seaborn.


# Evaluate the Results
In this section, we delved into the operational aspects and the dynamics of the business, exploring the demands and expectations from a data scientist functioning as a business analyst. Our approach also integrated advanced features aimed at enhancing business precision in a contemporary context.

Project Overview:

We posed four key questions to unravel insights about the Airbnb landscape in Boston. These questions guided our analysis of the dataset:

What is the distribution of room types?
How do property types break down by percentage?
What is the distribution of bed types among the listings?
Sentiment Analysis: What insights can we derive from customer reviews?
Each question aimed to provide a deeper understanding of the market dynamics and user preferences within the Airbnb ecosystem in Boston.
