# Boston Airbnb Data Analysis: Insights and Exploration
## Project Overview
In the realm of data science, insights are often hidden within datasets waiting to be discovered. As part of my Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree project, I embarked on an in-depth analysis of Boston's Airbnb data. This exploration aimed to uncover patterns and insights based on specific criteria, shedding light on the dynamics of the hospitality market in Boston.

## Business Understanding
In this section, we gained insights into the operations, business nature, demand dynamics, and the role of a data scientist working as a business analyst. Our approach focused on integrating features to enhance business accuracy and efficiency.

Questions Explored
We aimed to answer four key questions to understand the Airbnb landscape in Boston:

Q1 - What is room type?
Q2 - What is the breakdown of property types by percentage?

Each entry represents a unique listing with comprehensive accommodation and host characteristics.

Data Preparation
During the data preparation phase, we collected, assessed, and cleaned the dataset. This involved focusing on selected columns and leveraging Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas for data cleaning and organization.

Data Modeling
Using Python libraries matplotlib and seaborn, we visualized various behaviors related to the four questions posed, aiming to uncover insights into Boston's Airbnb market dynamics.
